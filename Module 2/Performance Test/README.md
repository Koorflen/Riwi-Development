# My Personal Portfolio - Alejandro

This is a personal website created as a performance test for Module 2 of HTML and CSS at Riwi. The purpose of this site is to showcase my frontend web development skills and serve as a contact point for potential collaborators or employers.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple independent HTML files for each main section, following best practices for modularity:

* `index.html`: Home/Welcome page.
* `About me.html`: Section dedicated to personal introduction.
* `projects.html`: Section with the project gallery.
* `contact.html`: Section with the contact form.
* `styles.css`: Main stylesheet for the entire site.
* `Assets/`: Folder for project images and other graphic resources.

## Key Features

* **Personal Presentation**: A section dedicated to introducing myself and my skills.
* **Project Portfolio**: A gallery featuring at least three highlighted projects.
* **Contact Form**: A form for visitors to get in touch with me.
* **Responsive Design**: The site adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
* **Attractive Styling**: Uses external CSS, colors, shadows, custom typography, and smooth transitions.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5 (with semantic structure)
* CSS3 (with Flexbox and CSS Grid for responsive layout)

## How to View the Project

1.  Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Koorflen/Riwi-Development.git`
2.  Navigate to the project folder: `cd your-personal-site`
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to start.

## Acceptance Criteria Met

* **HTML Structure**: Semantic HTML tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`) are used correctly. All required sections (presentation, portfolio, and contact) are present and functional on independent pages.
* **CSS Styling**: The `styles.css` file is well-structured and separated from the HTML. Consistent styles are applied in colors, typography, and transitions.
* **Responsive Design**: The site correctly adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile resolutions. Flexbox and Grid are correctly implemented to organize the content.
* **Interactivity**: Buttons and links have smooth transitions. Portfolio elements show hover effects upon interaction.

## Graphic Resources

All graphic resources used in the layout must be present in the `Assets/` folder.
